<h2 align="center">Overview</h1>

<p align="justify"> This repository contains Terraform configuration files to deploy a virtual machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure cloud platform. The main purpose of this deployment is to showcase how to create a VM instance using Terraform and enable SSH access to it. </p>

<h2 align="center">Description</h1>

#### In the main file, we will find:

* **Resource Group**: Creates an Azure resource group where all the resources will reside.

* **Virtual Network**: Sets up a virtual network (VNet) to provide network connectivity for the VM.

* **Subnet**: Defines a subnet within the virtual network to segment the network traffic.

* **Public IP Address**: Allocates a static public IP address for the VM to allow external connectivity.

* **Network Security Group**: Configures a network security group to control inbound and outbound traffic to the VM.

* **Network Interface**: Creates a network interface for the VM, which connects it to the virtual network.

* **Network Security Rule**: Defines a network security rule to allow SSH traffic (TCP port 22) to the VM.

Additionally, the script provisions the Azure virtual machine itself with the following specifications:

* **Size**: Specifies the VM size as "Standard_DS1_v2" (adjustable based on requirements).

* **Operating System**: Uses an Ubuntu Server image from Canonical with the latest LTS version.

* **OS Disk**: Configures the operating system disk with caching, managed disk type, and creates it from the specified image.

* **OS Profile**: Sets the computer name, admin username, and admin password for logging into the VM.

* **Linux Configuration**: Enables password authentication for the Linux OS profile.


> NOTE
* Ensure that the admin_username and admin_password fields in the os_profile section are appropriately set to your desired values.

> Use the same credentials to create this virtual machine and avoid errors, as it is a practice resource.

####Finally, we proceed to create it with the Terraform commands.
1. **terraform init**: Initializes the Terraform environment.

2. **terraform validate**: Validates the syntax and configuration of Terraform files.

3. **terraform plan**: Generates a plan of infrastructure changes.

4. **terraform fmt**: Applies consistent formatting to Terraform code.

5. **terraform apply**: Applies the changes defined in Terraform files.
